This is a remake of "Die Kathedrale und der Basar", a german translation
of Eric S. Raymond's Work "The Cathedral and the bazar". 

I used the translation of Reinhard Gantar, which is based on the version 
of August 8th 1999. 

While my change seems to be trivial ( i just added a hyperlinked table
of Contents, so it's just a modernization ), I had to copy&paste the content
of the original translation page by page. 

Additionally, I had to fix Page Breaks and Line Breaks which were made after pasting. 

I used LibreOffice to export to PDF and some other File Formats. 

The folder TCATB.orig.esr contains the actual original text by Eric S. Raymond, manually 
grabbed from his website, the folder DKUDB.orig.trans contains the PDF-file where my version 
is based on, and the folder DKUDB.rm.trans contains my version in differend file formats, 
such as PDF, txt, DocBook XML etc. 

I hope you enjoy.
