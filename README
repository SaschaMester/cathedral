This is a remake of "Die Kathedrale und der Basar", a german translation
of Eric S. Raymond's Work "The Cathedral and the bazar". 

I used the translation of Reinhard Gantar, which is based on the version 
of August 8th 1999. 

While my change seems to be trivial ( i just added a hyperlinked table
of Contents, so it's just a modernization ), I had to copy&paste the content
of the original translation page by page. 

Additionally, I had to fix Page Breaks and Line Breaks which were made after pasting. 

I used LibreOffice to export to PDF and some other File Formats. 

I hope you enjoy.
